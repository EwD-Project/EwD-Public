# EwD Reading Rules

(Curated for EwD v3.1)

Before delving into the diacritical marks of EwD, hereby called only _marks_ for brevity, it's important to assimilate a few core rules. In this document we present these rules, which we refer to as the **EwD Reading Rules**.

Some rule items are applied only after a certain EwD level. We affixed the [L3+] tag when the item is applied at levels L3 and L4, and the [L4] tag when the item is applied only at L4 (the final level). _If you are a beginner, you may skip reading these items._

Next are the 6 Reading Rules of EwD:

## Rule No. 1 – The Final Silent “E”

¶1 – Any single “e” at the end of a word is silent, unless it _carries a mark_ or it _is the sole vowel in the word_.

> E.g. (silent): late, bike, hăve, we͡re, more, able, smo͞othe
>
> E.g. (pronounced):
>
> - rĕcipe̱ – Carries mark.
> - me – Sole vowel of the word.

¶2 – If a final silent “e” receives an “-s” ending, that “e” is _still considered a final silent “e”_.

> E.g.: hopes, believes, wōlves

## Rule No. 2 – “I” and “Y” Treated the Same Way

¶ – The letter “y” is pronounced exactly like the letter “i” in 2 common situations:

1. When it functions as a core vowel, that is, when it is the **syllable nucleus**.

   > E.g.:
   >
   > - bite, I, type, my – ⟨Long-i⟩ sound.
   > - bit, hippie, hymn̥, sylla̬ble – ⟨Short-i⟩ sound.

2. When it's part of **falling diphthongs**.

   > E.g.:
   >
   > - wait, clay, vein, they – ⟨Long-a⟩ sound.
   > - noise, boy – ⟨“oy”⟩ sound.

## Rule No. 3 – Stressed Syllables

In this Rule we cover the most important aspects of reading EwD texts with regard to syllabic stress. English is a _stress-timed language_, so mastering this trait is crucial for both pronunciation and listening.

Please note that, while Sub-Rules 3.1 to 3.3 are intended for all proficiency levels, items 3.4 to 3.6 are _reserved for more advanced learners_.

### Sub-Rule 3.1 – Default Stressed Syllable

¶1 – The default stress syllable in EwD is the **first syllable**. This means that in the absence of certain conditions the first syllable always receives the primary stress (S1)\*.

> E.g.: nature, excellent, temperature, infini̯te

\* In EwD teaching we refer to _primary stress_ as **S1** and _secondary stress_ as **S2**.

¶2 – Each of the other Sub-Rules below represents one of the aforementioned conditions for which the first syllable may not get the S1.

### Sub-Rule 3.2 – Strong Marks

¶1 – <a id="note1b" href="#note1">Strong marks¹</a> always attract stress to their respective syllables, leaving the first syllable unstressed or with S2, depending on the word meter.

> E.g.:
>
> - matūre, untĭl, anôther – First syllable gets unstressed.
> - correspŏnd, technolŏgical, fundamĕntal – First syllable gets S2.

¶2 – If two syllables in a word get a strong mark of same <a id="note2b" href="#note2">tonic priority (TP)²</a>, then the first one gets the S2 and the second one gets the S1 (1st→S2 and 2nd→S1).

> E.g.: ăcadĕmic, pronŭnciātion, sĕrotōnin

### Sub-Rule 3.3 – Vowel Digraphs/Trigraphs:

¶1 – In a similar way as strong marks, vowel digraphs and trigraphs, as a rule, also attract the S1. They can be seen as _implicit strong marks_.

> E.g.: bel<b>ie</b>ve, ab<b>ou</b>t, ton<b>igh</b>t

¶2 – The only exceptions are the endings -ies, -ied, -ow and -ous, which tend to remain unstressed.

> E.g. (all levels): stor<b>ies</b>, carr<b>ied</b>, foll<b>ow</b>
>
> E.g. (L3+): fam<b>ous̩</b>

### [L3+] Sub-Rule 3.4 – Stress-Magnet Suffixes:

Stress-magnet suffixes attract the S1 to the _previous syllable_. The two default stress-magnet suffixes in EwD are “-ion” and “-ian”.

> E.g. (L3):
>
> - -ion: ĕdu<b>ca</b>tion\*, con<b>fu</b>sion
> - -ian: mu̱<b>si</b>cian, vĕge<b>ta</b>rian\*

\* Note that the presence of a strong mark (other than the Acute) in another syllable _doesn't affect_ the S1 induced by the stress-magnet suffix. In such cases, the syllable with strong mark gets S2 instead.

### [L4] Sub-Rule 3.5 – Verbs whose last syllable is convertible into strong:

In this case, the last syllable may _receive the S1 or the S2_. The exact pattern depends on the word meter and on the accent spoken.

> E.g. (L4):
>
> - begin, complete(v), correct(v) – Last syllable gets the S1.
> - expériment(v), séparate(v) – Last syllable gets the S2.

### [L4] Sub-Rule 3.6 – Verb with the “-en” suffix:

For verbs, the “-en” suffix act as a _stress-magnet suffix_, and therefore the _penultimate syllable gets the S1_. There's a <a id="note3b" href="#note3">historical reason³</a> for this phenomenon.

> E.g. (L4): forgotten, mistaken, embolden

## Rule No. 4 – Natural Vowels

¶ – Natural vowels are **simple vowels** (a/e/i/y/o/u) whose pronunciation is _dictated by the letters to the right of them_. As such, they don't need the corresponding duration mark (Macron or Breve) to indicate their quality.

> E.g.: cute, cut, cutter, able, apple

There are 2 kinds of natural vowels: **natural long** and **natural short** vowels.

### Sub-Rule 4.1 – Natural Long Vowel

¶1 – Natural long vowels are vowels that are pronounced long _without the need of the Macron mark_ to indicate this.

There are 2 Scenarios for natural long vowels:

1. Vowel followed by **a single consonant** and then **a vowel**.

   > E.g.: ate, these, bite, hope, cute

2. Vowel followed by **2 consonants in which the second is a liquid consonant** (“l” or “r”), and then followed by **a vowel**.

   > E.g.: able, idle, ogre

¶2 (Note) – The letter “x” is considered as **two consonants** for the purpose of this rule, and therefore is treated as an exception. Refer to the Sub-Rule below for clarification.

> E.g.: axe, exit, boxing

### Sub-Rule 4.2 – Natural Short Vowel

¶ – Natural short vowels are the _counterparts_ of natural long vowels. They are pronounced short _without the need of the Breve mark_ to indicate this.

There are 4 Scenarios for natural short vowels:

1. Vowel followed by **2 or more consonant letters**\* or by **the letter “x”**.

   > E.g.: apple, clashes, tremble, middle, monster, cutter

   \* Except when the second letter in a pair is a liquid consonant (“l” or “r”). This case is treated by the Scenario 2 of the previous Sub-Rule.

2. Vowel followed by **a consonant at the end of the word**.

   > E.g.: that, when, is, not, cut

3. [L3+] Vowel “i” in a syllable followed by a **stress-magnet suffix**. In this scenario the “i” will always sound ⟨short-i⟩.

   > E.g. (L3+): ignition, vision, musician

4. [L4] Vowel in a **stressed syllable** followed by **2 or more syllables**. This phenomemon is known as _trisyllabic laxing_.

   > E.g. (L4): animal, every, colony

## Rule No. 5 – Compound Words

¶1 – In cases where pronouncing <a id="note4b" href="#note4">compound words⁴</a> as seamless simple words could lead to mispronunciations, EwD employs the so-called **compound word dividers**. They indicate that the segments of a word (called “subwords”) _should be pronounced distinctly_, as if they were separate words.

¶2 – They also guide readers on _where to place the primary stress_ of the whole word.

The 2 compound word dividers of EwD are as follows:

1. **Middle Dot** ( · )

   Indicates that the primary stress of the compound word falls on **a subword to the left of it**. For double compound words, it indicates that the primary stress falls on _the first subword_.

   > E.g.: pine·apple, sôme·one, ĕve̥ry·t‍̤hing

2. **Double Dot** ( ꞉ )
   Indicates that the primary stress of the compound word falls on **the subword to the right of it**.

   > E.g.: al꞉be·it, he͡r꞉self, nône·the̬꞉less

## Rule No. 6 – Silent Consonants

¶ – There are 5 Scenarios in which a consonant letter or digraph is systematically silent:

1. Initial “k” before “n”.

   > E.g.: knōw, knee, knife

2. Initial “w” before “r”.

   > E.g.: write, wrong, wrath

3. “gh” in the syllable coda (after the vowel of the syllable).

   > E.g.: t‍̤hröugh, right, weight

4. [L3+] Word “who” and derivatives.

   > E.g. (L3+): whö, whöm, whöse

5. [L3+] Initial consonant cluster whose first consonant is _not phonetically natural in English_.\*

   > E.g. (L3+): psyc‍̤ho, gnome, mnemŏnic

   \* The first Scenario (initial “k” before “n”) is actually a case of this one, but it's treated separately due to its commonness.
