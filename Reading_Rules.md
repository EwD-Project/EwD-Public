# EwD Reading Rules

(for EwD v3)

Before learning the **diacritical marks** of EwD (hereby called only _marks_ for brevity) and the purpose of each of them, it's important to assimilate a few _core rules_. In this document we present these rules, which we refer to as the EwD **Reading Rules**.

Some rule items are applied only after a certain EwD level. We affixed the [L3+] tag when the item is applied at levels L3 and L4, and the [L4] tag when the item is applied only at L4 (the final level). _If you are a beginner, you may skip reading these items._

Next are the 6 Reading Rules of EwD:

## Rule No. 1 – The Final Silent “E”

¶1 – Any single “e” at the end of a word is silent, unless it _carries a mark_ or it _is the sole vowel in the word_.

> E.g. (silent): late, bike, hăve, we͡re, more, able, smo͞othe
>
> E.g. (pronounced):
>
> - coffee > Double “e”.
> - rĕcipe̱ > Carries mark.
> - me > Sole vowel of the word.

¶2 – If a final silent “e” receives an “-s” ending, that “e” is _still considered a final silent “e”_.

> E.g.: hopes, believes, wōlves

## Rule No. 2 – “I” and “Y” Treated the Same Way

¶ – The letter “y” is pronounced exactly like the letter “i” in 2 common situations:

1. When it functions as a core vowel, that is, when it is the **syllable nucleus**.

   > E.g.:
   >
   > - bite, I, type, my > ⟨long-i⟩ sound.
   > - bit, hippie, hymn̊, syllable > ⟨short-i⟩ sound.

2. When it's part of **falling diphthongs**.

   > E.g.:
   >
   > - wait, clay, vein, they > ⟨long-a⟩ sound.
   > - noise, boy > ⟨“oy”⟩ sound.

## Rule No. 3 – Stressed Syllables

### Sub-Rule 3.1 – Default Stressed Syllable

¶1 – The first syllable of each word is **stressed by default**. That means that, in the absence of certain conditions, the first syllable always receives the primary stress\*.

> E.g.: nature, excellent, temperature, infini̯te

\* For information on primary stress (S1) and secondary stress (S2), read <a id="note1b" href="#note1">Note 1</a>.

¶2 – Each of the other Sub-Rules below represents one of these conditions for which the first syllable won't get the S1.

### Sub-Rule 3.2 – Strong Marks

¶1 – <a id="note2b" href="#note2">Strong marks²</a> always attract stress to their respective syllables, leaving the first syllable unstressed or with S2, depending on the word meter.

> E.g.:
>
> - matūre, untĭl, anôther > First syllable gets unstressed.
> - correspŏnd, technolŏgical, fundamĕntal > First syllable gets S2.

¶2 – If two syllables in a word get a strong mark of same <a id="note3b" href="#note3">tonic priority³</a>, then the second one gets the S1 and the first one gets the S2 (2nd→S1 and 1st→S2).

> E.g.: ăcadĕmic, pronŭnciātion, sĕrotōnin

### Sub-Rule 3.3 – Vowel digraphs/trigraphs:

In the same way as strong marks, vowel digraphs and trigraphs, as a rule, attract the S1.

> E.g.: believe, about, tonight

### [L3+] Sub-Rule 3.4 – Stress-magnet suffixes:

Stress-magnet suffixes attract the stress to the _previous syllable_. The two default stress-magnet suffixes in EwD are “-ion” and “-ian”.

> E.g. (L3+):
>
> - -ion: education, confusion
> - -ian: vegetarian, musician

### [L4] Sub-Rule 3.5 – Verbs whose last syllable is convertible into strong:

In this case, the last syllable may **attract the S1 or the S2**. The exact pattern depends on the number of syllables of the word and on the spoken accent.

> E.g. (L4):
>
> - begin, complete(v), correct(v) > Last syllable gets the S1.
> - expĕriment(v), sĕparate(v) > Last syllable gets the S2.

### [L4] Sub-Rule 3.6 – Verb with the “-en” suffix:

For verbs, the “-en” suffix act as a _stress-magnet suffix_, and therefore the _penultimate syllable gets the S1_. There's a <a id="note4b" href="#note4">historical reason⁴</a> for this phenomenon.

> E.g. (L4): enlighten, forgotten, mistaken

## Rule No. 4 – Natural Vowels

¶ – Natural vowels are **simple vowels** (a/e/i/y/o/u) whose pronunciation is _dictated by the letters to the right of them_. As such, they don't need the corresponding duration mark (Macron or Breve) to indicate their quality.

> E.g.: cute, cut, cutter, able, apple

There are 2 kinds of natural vowels: **natural long** and **natural short** vowels.

### Sub-Rule 4.1 – Natural Long Vowel

¶1 – Natural long vowels are vowels that are pronounced long _without the need of the Macron mark_ to indicate that.

There are 2 Scenarios for natural long vowels:

1. Vowel followed by **a single consonant** and then **a vowel**.

   > E.g.: ate, these, bite, hope, cute

2. Vowel followed by **2 consonants in which the second is a liquid consonant** (“l” or “r”), and then followed by **a vowel**.

   > E.g.: able, idle, ogre

¶2 (Note) – The letter “x” is considered as **two consonants** for the purpose of this rule, and therefore is treated as an exception. Refer to the Sub-Rule below for clarification.

> E.g.: axe, exit, boxing

### Sub-Rule 4.2 – Natural Short Vowel

¶ – Natural short vowels are the _counterparts_ of natural long vowels. They are pronounced short _without the need of the Breve mark_ to indicate that.

There are 4 Scenarios for natural short vowels:

1. Vowel followed by **2 or more consonant letters**\* or by **the letter “x”**.

   > E.g.: apple, clashes, tremble, middle, monster, cutter

   \* Except when the second letter in a pair is a liquid consonant (“l” or “r”). This case is treated by the Scenario 2 of the previous Sub-Rule.

2. Vowel followed by **a consonant at the end of the word**.

   > E.g.: that, when, is, not, cut

3. [L3+] Vowel “i” in a syllable followed by a **stress-magnet suffix**. In this scenario the “i” will always sound ⟨short-i⟩.

   > E.g. (L3+): ignition, vision, musician

4. [L4] Vowel in a **stressed syllable** followed by **2 or more syllables**. This phenomemon is known as _trisyllabic laxing_.

   > E.g. (L4): animal, every, colony

## Rule No. 5 – Compound Words

¶1 – In cases where pronouncing <a id="note5b" href="#note5">compound words⁵</a> as seamless simple words could lead to mispronunciations, EwD employs the so-called **compound word dividers**. They indicate that the segments of a word (called “subwords”) _should be pronounced distinctly_, as if they were separate words.

¶2 – They also guide readers on _where to place the primary stress_ of the whole word.

The 2 compound word dividers of EwD are as follows:

1. **Middle Dot** ( · )

   Indicates that the primary stress of the compound word falls on **a subword to the left of it**. For double compound words, it indicates that the primary stress falls on _the first subword_.

   > E.g.: pine·apple, sôme·one, ĕve̥ry·t‍̤hing

2. **Double Dot** ( ꞉ )
   Indicates that the primary stress of the compound word falls on **the subword to the right of it**.

   > E.g.: al꞉be·it, he͡r꞉self, nône·the̬꞉less

## Rule No. 6 – Silent Consonants

¶ – There are 5 Scenarios in which a consonant letter or digraph is systematically silent:

1. Initial “k” before “n”.

   > E.g.: knōw, knee, knife

2. Initial “w” before “r”.

   > E.g.: write, wrong, wrath

3. “gh” after the vowel in a syllable.

   > E.g.: t‍̤hröugh, right, weight

4. [L3+] Initial “w” before “-ho-” when “o” sounds ⟨long-u⟩.

   > E.g. (L3+): whö, whöm, whöse

5. [L3+] Initial consonant cluster for which the first consonant is _not phonemically possible_.\*

   > E.g. (L3+): psyc‍̤ho, gnome, mnemŏnic

   \* The first Scenario (initial “k” before “n”) is actually a case of this one, but it's treated separately due to its commonness.
